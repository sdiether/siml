# Synopsis

This repository contains popular Machine Learning algorithms, which have been introduced in various blog posts (http://ataspinar.com). Most of the algorithms are accompanied with blog-posts in which I try to explain the mathematics behind and the interpretation of these algorithms. 


# Motivation
Machine Learning is fun! But more importantly, Machine Learning is easy. 
But the academic literature or even (wikipedia-pages) is full with unnecessary complicated terminology, notation and formulae. This gives people the idea that these ML algorithms can only be understood with a full understanding of advanced math and statistics. Stripped from all of these superfluous language we are left with simple maths which can be expressed in a few lines of code. 

# Notebooks explaining the mathematics
I have also provided some notebooks, explaining the mathematics of some Machine Learning algorithms.

# Installation
To install **siML**:
```python
(sudo) pip install siml
```

or you can clone the repository and in the folder containing setup.py
```python
python setup.py install
```
